# Hackathon-24
```POWRÓT DO PRZe/ySZŁOŚĆI
Po angielsku by ai myslalo 
Style: PixelArt;

Main idea: 2D, lost in time, main character tries to go back to his time era, artefacts, modifying the course of history, searching items (to fix a portal, which is a time machine), teleportation between space-times (czasoprzestrzenie, + np planety); 

1 Ability at the start; 

Puzzles; 

D = move forward, move forward in time 

A = move backward, move backward in time; 

1 Boss – but we will do it at the end; 

About the progress in main character abilities, not so many abilities in total. Maybe 3-4 at max. . 

2-3 Levels, for now prototypes; 

The game starts in a temple (starożytność, nie ma dobrego slowa w ang do tego, antiquity) OR open area with antique city in background, which leads to hub; we find a first part for the portal, the portal leads us to the future 

Future – space ship = you search for parts and finally fix the portal correctly, which transforms into a...  

...Boss fight, about phases we still need to think about them, however after beating the boss, we get teleported to “nowadays” (terazniejszosc), and the game is over (in the good meaning);

To progress we need to rebuild gates in main hub 

3 levels = antiquity, nowadays, future;
